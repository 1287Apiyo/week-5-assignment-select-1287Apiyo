# Week 5: Databases and Web Applications - Bridging the Gap 

Great work last week! You've mastered data manipulation in your Expense Tracker. This week, we'll delve into the exciting connection between databases and web applications, even though we won't be coding the actual connection yet.

## Understanding the Connection:

Imagine you're browsing a social media platform. When you see posts from your friends, a web application interacts with a database in the background, retrieving relevant data (posts, comments, etc.). This magic happens through a powerful connection, but how?

## Exploring Database Options:

There's a range of database server options available, each with its strengths:

MySQL: A widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its flexibility and ease of use.

PostgreSQL: Another powerful open-source RDBMS offering advanced features like object-relational capabilities.

Microsoft SQL Server: A robust commercial RDBMS solution from Microsoft, often used in enterprise environments.

Oracle Database: A high-performance commercial RDBMS known for its scalability and security features.

Node.js: While not strictly a database server, Node.js is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment often used for building web applications. Node.js can interact with various databases using libraries and frameworks.

## Learning the Universal Language - SQL:

Regardless of the database server, SQL (Structured Query Language) acts as the common language for communication. It allows applications to interact with databases and perform various operations like:

Retrieving Data: SELECT statements fetch specific data from database tables.

Inserting Data: INSERT statements add new records to the database.

Updating Data: UPDATE statements modify existing data within a database.

Deleting Data: DELETE statements remove unwanted records from the database.

## Questions (2 hours):

1.1. Database Server Comparison:  
Create a table comparing the following database server options (focusing on its role as a web application environment): 
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle Database
* Node.js 

**Include details like (Tabulate):**

1. Type (Open-Source/Commercial)
2. Target Audience
3. Key Features
4. Ease of Use

## Bonus: Hands-on SQL Practice (Optional):

This section is an optional bonus for those who want to explore further. It will be covered in the Web Development module in detail, but the concepts will be helpful for this section.

Explore Node.js database SQL interaction capabilities for a simple HTML project (e.g., sign in/sign up pages).

**The goal is to:**

* Connect the project to a Node.js server.
* Write basic SQL queries to retrieve data from a sample database of your choice.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. Create an admin table and add it to the database you used in week 4.
2. Create a basic HTML form for user login or searching for items.
3. Connect the form to a Node.js server that interacts with the database using SQL queries.
4. Write at least three SELECT statements to retrieve relevant data from the database.
   
Remember: This bonus section provides a starting point for independent practice. Connecting HTML projects to Node.js servers and interacting with databases involves additional concepts that will be covered in future sessions or separate exercises.
